# Service Alerts Manager

## Overview

The Service Alerts Manager allows for the creation and management of Service Alerts for feed sources managed within the GTFS Data Manager.

## Alerts Viewer

The Alerts Viewer allows users to view, search for, and filter all present and past alerts.  A user may choose to edit one of the alerts in the list (if she has the appropriate permissions) or create a new alert.

### Editing an Alert

A user may edit an existing alert by clicking button with the pencil icon for the given alert.  This button may be disabled for a few permissions-related reasons:

1. if the user does not have permission to edit alerts for agencies contained within the alert OR
2. if the alert has been published, but the user does not have the **Approve Alert** privilege.

### Filtering Alerts

The list of alerts may be filtered in a couple of ways:

1. Searching the title by text, e.g. "BART"  ![Search by title](/img/filter-alerts.png "Search by title")  
2. Clicking one of the following filters:
    - **Active** - shows all active alerts (alerts that have begun, but not yet terminated)
    - **Future** - shows all future alerts (alerts that have not yet begun)
    - **Archived** - shows all archived alerts (alerts that have already terminated)
    - **Draft** - shows all draft alerts (alerts that have not yet been published/approved)
    - **All** - shows all alerts
3. Filtering by agency or sorting by title, start/end date, or date last edited.

### Creating a New Alert

On the main Alerts Viewer page, a user may create a new alert a few different ways.

1. Clicking the **New Alert** button.
2. Zooming into the map, selecting a route or stop feature and then clicking **Create Alert for XXX**.
3. Begin typing the name of a route or stop in the search bar above the map, selecting a route or stop from the list and then clicking **Create Alert for XXX**.

For more info on route/stop search, see [Searching for Routes and Stops](searching-routes-stops/).

## Alert Editor

Upon creating a new or editing an existing Service Alert, a user will see the Alert Editor view. Here you can specify all of the Service Alert properties.

### List of Service Alert Properties

1. **Alert Title** (required)
2. **Start and End Dates** (required)
3. **Alert Cause and Effect** (required)
4. **Description** (optional) - a brief description of the alert cause, effect or other relevant information.
5. **URL** (optional) - a fully qualified URL (http://example.com/alert/123) where riders can view information about the alert
6. **Affected Service** (required) - one or more services that are affected by the Service Alert.  Affected Service types are:
    - **Agency** - affects the entire Agency
    <!-- - **Mode** - affects an entire mode for a particular agency (e.g., all tram service for Muni) and can optionally apply to a single stop -->
    - **Stop/Route** - affects a single stop or route and can optionally be refined further by, respectively, a route or stop (e.g., Main St & 4th St Stop for Route 10 only)

### Adding Affected Service to a Service Alert

Adding affected service to a Service Alert can be done through clicking the **Add Agency** buttons or searching for and selecting a stop or route in the Affected Service panel. Users may also add stop/route service by searching for stops and routes through the map/search interface on the right side of the Alert Editor (similarly to creating a Service Alert for a stop/route).

Once a new Affected Service has been added, it will appear in the Affected Service panel. Clicking the newly added item will allow the user to change the selected service and/or refine the service further. For example, after adding a stop to the Affected Service list, the user may want to refine that stop to only include a certain route rather than affecting all service at this stop.

### Publishing, Saving and Deleting Alerts

Once finished, editing an alert, a user can save the alert by clicking the **Save** button in the upper righthand corner of the Alert Editor. After saving, the user will be redirected to the full list of alerts.

If the user has the **Approve Alert** permission, she may toggle the alert between unpublished (draft) and published states by clicking the toggle **Published?** button to the "checked" state or (if already published) to the "unchecked" state.

To delete the alert, click the red **Delete** button.  You will be asked to confirm this decision.  You may also delete alerts by clicking the **X** button for a given alert in the Alerts Viewer.
